# Project Roadmap

## 🚀 Short Term (Next Release)
- [ ] **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensure consistent rendering on Firefox and Safari (especially AudioContext and Canvas quirks).
- [ ] **Mobile Polish**:
    - Improve virtual joystick responsiveness.
    - Prevent accidental "pull-to-refresh" or browser gestures on swipe.
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Reduce object creation in the update loop (object pooling for particles).

## 📅 Medium Term (Content Expansion)
- [ ] **New Stages**:
    - *Kitchen*: Breakable plates, glasses, and a slippery floor.
    - *Bedroom*: Soft items (pillows) that don't break but muffle noise.
- [ ] **More Power-Ups**:
    - *Ninja Paws*: Move silently for 5 seconds.
    - *Hairball*: Shoot a projectile to break distant items.
- [ ] **Owner AI Upgrade**:
    - The owner occasionally wakes up and checks the room (requiring the player to hide).

## 🔮 Long Term (Features)
- [ ] **Online Leaderboards**: Global high score tracking (Firebase/Supabase implementation).
- [ ] **Native Mobile App**: Wrap the game using Capacitor or Cordova for App Store/Play Store release.
- [ ] **Achievement System**: "Break 1000 items", "Survive 5 minutes", "Complete without jumping".
