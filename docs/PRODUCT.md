# Product Overview

## 🎯 Purpose
**Cat Zoomies** is a "Cozy roguelite" experience designed to capture the mischievous joy of being a cat at night. It balances stress-relieving destruction with a relaxing, atmospheric aesthetic.

## 👥 Target Users
- **Cozy Gamers**: Players who enjoy low-stakes, aesthetically pleasing environments (e.g., *Neko Atsume*, *Unpacking*).
- **Cat Lovers**: People who resonate with the chaotic nature of feline behavior.
- **Micro-Session Players**: Designed for short 2-5 minute sessions on mobile or desktop.

## 🗝️ Key Features
1.  **Satisfying Physics**: Items have weight and momentum, making knocking them over feel tactile.
2.  **Risk/Reward Loop**: The "Noise Gauge" creates tension—destruction is fun, but too much noise wakes the owner.
3.  **Roguelite Progression**: Random power-ups (Catnip, Zoomies) ensure no two runs are the same.
4.  **Generative Art**: Unique, hand-drawn style visuals generated entirely by code, ensuring crispness on any device.

## 💼 Business Objectives
- **Portfolio Showcase**: Demonstrate mastery of the Canvas API, procedural generation, and game loop architecture without reliance on asset heavy frameworks.
- **Engagement**: Achieve a high retention rate through the "one more run" addictive quality of the Roguelite loop.
